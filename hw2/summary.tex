\paragraph{Summary} It's time to build your first end-to-end learning system! In this assignment, you will build a Decision Tree classifier and apply it to several binary classification problems. This assignment consists of several parts: In the Written component, you will work through some pseudocode that will help you algorithmically think through the programming assignment. Then in the Programming component, you will implement Decision Tree learning, prediction, and evaluation. Using that implementation, you will answer the empirical questions found at the end of the Written component.
